## ChangeLog

### 1.2-RC1 - 2019-11-13

**Enhancements**

* Support for BT A2DP sink with Alexa.
* Support for setting device configuration via companion app. Below are the configuration options settable/gettable via the app:
    * Assistant's language
    * Device name (visible over local network after provisioning)
    * Device volume
    * Alexa WW detection tone (start tone)
    * Query end tone (end tone)
* Support for displaying WiFi's authentication mode (open or secure) in the app during provisioning.
* Support for streaming binary/octate-stream media content type.
* Support for 5 linear LED patterns for Alexa events.

**API Changes**

* Removed `va_playback` from alexa_config_t. It is now being handled internally.
* `media_hal.c` is made common to all boards.
* `va_dsp_init` api now requires two callback parameters `va_dsp_recognize_cb_t` and `va_dsp_record_cb_t`.
* Alexa device's "Product ID" can now also be specified from menuconfig.

**Bug Fixes**

* Long duration stability improvements.
* Fixed a memory leak of 48 bytes after each NVS operation.
* Fixed occasional WDT exceptions during OTA.
* Updated certificate for Dialogflow and GVA.
* Using custom 128-bit UUIDs for BLE services and characteristics instead of standard 16-bit UUIDs.

**Known Issues**

* Enabling BT A2DP sink requires flash size > 4MB.
* Exhaustion of internal memory when BT A2DP sink is enabled may lead to a crash. This is applicable for boards running Wakeword detection on the host (ESP32).

### 1.0-RC2 - 2019-08-13

**Enhancements**

* Added LED support for Error LED and Provisioning LED.
* Memory optimisations to improve the overall functionality and stability.
* Added an API to change the locale for amazon_alexa. Also added a cli for the same.
* Added support for sign-in and sign-out via the app.
* Added basic support for OTA. The APIs still need to be implemented by the application. (refer to examples/amazon_alexa/main/app_cloud_agent.h)
* Support for Gaana (India) and Hungama (India) music streaming services.
* Provisioning app for iOS has also been added. The existing Android app has been updated.
* Added error message in addition to error LEDs when the wake word is detected and the device is having trouble processing it.
* Added support for equalizer.
* Added support for text queries for google_dialogflow. Also added a CLI for the same.

**API Changes**

* The 'avs_nvs_*' APIs have been changed to 'va_nvs' and 'avs' is used as the default namespace.
* Authentication components have been moved from alexa.h to auth_delegate.h. Refer to the respective files for the changes.
* `media_hal_data.c` is now made common and is not a part of `board_support_pkgs/<board_name>/esp_codec/` anymore.
  * This complete logic is now moved to `components/media_hal/`. Please take a look at (media_hal_playback.h)[components/media_hal/].
  * audio board must initialize `media_hal` using `media_hal_init_playback` with config. For example, for (lyrat_board)[board_support_pkgs/lyrat/audio_boar/audio_board_lyrat/audio_board_lyrat.c].
* APIs for tone have been changed to support the above media_hal change.

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed some memory leaks.
* Some fixes to pass Amazon's certification.

### 1.0-RC1 - 2019-05-14

**Enhancements**

This release is a major update to the previous release and includes the following changes:
* Alexa:
 * All the Alexa functional and music certification tests can now be passed with this release.
 * Robustness enhancements that pass 100-hour long duration stress tests.
 * Wi-Fi and Alexa configuration on BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) makes the provisioning experience much smoother (This mandates that you upgrade to the latest phone apps while using this release.).
   * Newer app and firmware supports WiFi scanlist as well.
 * Supports greater number of music stations because of:
   * Greater tolerance for variance in different music stations M3U8 formats.
   * Support for additional 'Content-Type' as reported by some music stations.
* Improved directory structure to add flexibility to provide way to test other ESP32 based audio boards. Examples can be build and flashed on any of the following development boards with proper "AUDIO_BOARD_PATH" provided:
 1. LyraT
 2. LyraTD-SYNA
 3. LyraTD-DSPG
 4. LyraTD-MSC

* LEDs and tones are added for GVA and Dialogflow.
* Support for setting custom tones.
* nvs-set CLI supports setting and getting int16_t variable type.

**API Changes**

* Examples directories are renamed according to voice assistants. There are now 3 examples viz., amazon_alexa, google_voice_assistant and google_dialogflow.
* BLE provisioning and authentication for Alexa instead of SoftAP provisioning.
* Local Player, Equalizer and AWS-IoT are moved inside amazon_alexa/additional_components/
* voice_assistant_app_cb.h:
  * va_app_set_volume() is now deprected. A new function va_app_volume_is_set() is now introduced. Earlier the app had to change the volume itself. Now this is directly handled in the medial-hal layer. The application layer only gets a notification once the volume changed has happened.
  * va_app_set_mute() is now deprected. A new function va_app_mute_is_set() is now introduced. Earlier the app had to mute the volume itself. Now this is directly handled in the medial-hal layer. The application layer only gets a notification once the mute change has happened.
* A new API va_boot_is_finish() is introduced that allows applications to wait until the complete boot-up has finished.
* A new API tone_set_custom() lets application override the existing tone with a custom tone that can be played.
* The audio_player_stop() API is now updated to include one additional parameter which is a notify callback.
* The alexa_config_t structure now includes two additional members 'device_serial_num' and 'product_id' which are now used for communication with the AVS service.


**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed Whatâ€™s up interruption stalling the device.
* Code restructuring in the SDK to fix various race conditions occurring during long-duration testing
* Improved stability for if the Internet or Wi-Fi connectivity is intermittent.
* All well known TuneIn radio stations are now supported.

**API Changes**

* Example directories are renamed.

**Bug Fixes**

* Background noise in audio with lower sampling rates.
* In case of incorrect provisioning parameters, device needed to be reset via command line (via esptool.py on host or nvs-erase on device). Now reset-to-factory push button (Mode) could also be used.
* Capabilities are announced automatically when an updated firmware with new capabilities is flashed onto the device.
